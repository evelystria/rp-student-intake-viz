# RP Student Intake Visualization
A mini project I am working on which visualizes RP Student Intake from the AY2012 to present. The purpose is to see the data at a more simplified and clearer perspective, and to see what courses are trendy during the respective years. It is built on Plotly's dash framework which I recently found which made me want to try it out.

Data source is taken from https://www.rp.edu.sg/

## Progress (35%~)
The app now displays only the number of intake per course in the respective schools. It is poorly coded at the moment, however that will be my last concern.

My next step will be implementing more graphs (eg. Most/Least popular course, etc..) for my personal data analytics which I will be doing later.

## Disclaimer
Though the data is taken from RP website, over the years some courses are removed, merged and new ones are introduced. Hence it is not accurate but rather a rough estimation of what it is.
